## OAuth 2.0 Definition

Here is the official definition of of OAuth 2.0 according to
[RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749):

"The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to
obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource
owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner
and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain
access on its own behalf."

That is quite a confusing definition!

Don't worry! After reading through this article, try to read this
definition again. I promise you it will make sense.

Okay, let's go!

One of the main use cases of OAuth 2.0 is to give third party applications
limited access to the private resources that you own. We will see how that
is exactly done throughout this article. Let's discuss an example where
OAuth can be used.

Let's say you are tracking your fitness activities through a sport activity
tracking application called
[Strava](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strava-run-bike-walk/id426826309).
You would like Strava to automatically make a post on your behalf to your
Facebook account so your friends can see your sports activity.

Throughout this article, we’ll explore several methods for connecting
Strava to your Facebook account. We’ll begin with the simplest connection
options and progress toward implementing a complete OAuth flow:

Don't worry if the above animation looks confusing. We're going to start
off very simple. You will eventually undersatnd this flow when you get to
the end of this article. I believe in you!

First of all, let's discuss the various components that we will see when
learning OAuth 2.0.

## OAuth 2.0 Components

- **Resource Owner**: This is a real person who controls access to an API
  and can grant limited permission to another application. In other words,
  they decide to share access to certain parts of their API with another
  app. The resource owner also uses a web browser to approve this access.
  In our example, the resource owner is you 🫵! You own the Facebook
  account (the API) that Strava wants limited access to, so it can make a
  Facebook post on your behalf.
- **Protected Resource**: The component that the resource owner (you) has
  access to. This is normally an API. In our example, the Protected
  Resource will be your Facebook account.
- **Client**: The piece of software that accesses the protected resource
  (your Facebook account) on behalf of the resource owner (you). In our
  example the Client is the Strava.

Let's map out the OAuth components once again according to our example:

- You are the OAuth `Resource Owner` since you are the owner of your
  Facebook account.
- Your Facebook account is the OAuth `Protected Resource`.
- Strava is the OAuth `Client` that is trying to get access to Facebook on
  your behalf to make a Facebook post of what exercise you did so your
  friends can see that you're not lazy!

The end goal is for Strava to be given access to your Facebook account in
order to make posts. In other words, you as the user need to delegate
authorization to the Client (Strava), so the Client can access the
Protected Resource (your Facebook account).

I see how the Resource Owner, Client, and Protected Resource relate to our Strava example now!

Let's see how we can authorize Strava to make a Facebook post on your
behalf.

## Client Authorization

Let's think of the most basic authorization setup in order for Strava to
connect to your Facebook account. Strava asks you for the username and
password of your Facebook account and connects on your behalf.

![You provide your password to Strava. Then Strava uses your password to publish posts.](../images/intro-oauth-2.png "You provide your password to Strava. Then Strava uses your password to publish posts.")

Although, there are many problems with this approach, the goal is achieved!
Strava can now make posts on your behalf to your Facebook account! There
are definitely areas of improvement in this setup. Let's look at the
current challenges we face with this setup:

- Strava has total control of your Facebook account and can do any action.
- Facebook has no way of differentiating between you and Strava since
  Strava is using the same username and password that you are using to
  login.
- Strava has stored your username and password on its database for use in
  the future. So it does not have to notify you every time it will post on
  Facebook.

Yikes! By solving the connection problem for Strava to post on your
Facebook account on your behalf, we seem to have made quite a mess! We can
do better!

Here is another solution: what if Strava could create a partnership with
Facebook and get access to _all_ Facebook accounts by using a very secret
password that is given by Facebook to Strava. This secret password would
only allow Strava to make posts for users and nothing else. For example,
Strava will not be able to send a Facebook friend a direct message on
behalf of any user. Strava will _only_ be allowed to publish Facebook posts
on behalf of any user.

![Strava can post to any facebook account using it's all powerful token!](../images/intro-oauth-3.png "Strava can post to any facebook account using it's all powerful token!")

As in the previous solution, the end goal is reached. Strava is now
connected to your Facebook and can publish posts on your behalf. The
benefit of this solution is that Strava will not have a need to ask for
your password. Strava would just need to know your username and use it's
all powerful, secret password given by Facebook to make a post on your
behalf. Just like it can do for any other user. Although this approach
solves some of the problems mentioned in the previous solution, there are
still some glaring flaws:

- If Strava gets hacked, then Facebook would be compromised since the
  hackers are now in control of the very powerful password that can make
  posts on behalf of any user.
- It's highly unlikely that Facebook would ever give any app this kind of
  powerful permission.
- You, as a user do not have much control in this situation. For example,
  you can't revoke Strava's access to your Facebook account. Strava can
  freely make posts on your behalf whenever it wants.

:::sweatingDuck
That’s concerning!! Even if Strava achieves the goal by posting on Facebook
for me, it still shouldn’t have that level of access.

:::

:::me
Don't worry. Let's take this solution a little further!
:::
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

What if you could give Strava a special Facebook password (other than your
real password) that lets it post on your behalf but nothing else. For
example, Strava wouldn’t be able to see your friends list because this
password only grants the permission needed to publish posts. We’ll call
this special password a `token.`

![The user gives Strava a special password (token) that only allows for publishing posts on the resource owner's account](../images/intro-oauth-4.png "The user gives Strava a special token (password) that only allows for publishing posts on the resource owner's account")

This is looking much better than the very first solution of Strava
replaying the user credentials to Facebook. Strava now only has access to
posting on your behalf. You can revoke access to Strava at any time by
changing the password that you provided Strava. Also, Strava does not have
universal access to make posts for any user anymore. Although this is a
good solution, it is still not optimal. Let's discuss the challenges we
face with this setup:

- What if you as a user have several fitness apps that track your health
  and post for you on your Facebook account. You would have to manage
  several tokens (password) for each fitness app. You could provide the
  same token for each fitness app but that would lead to a security risk.
  Meaning, if one fitness app token is compromised, all other fitness apps
  would be at risk.
- There is no way for you to revoke access to Strava other than changing
  your password. So there is no correlation between the Strava (client) and
  the token.

:::strongme
We can still do better!

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

What if we were able to have this token issued separately for each client
and user combination to be used at a protected resource, such as your
Facebook account? What if there was a network protocol that allowed for the
generation and secure distribution of these tokens? Now we are getting
somewhere!

## Delegating Access

The network protocol in question is called OAuth 2.0! Once again, the end
goal is for you, the user to _delegate_ your authority of your Facebook
account to Strava, so it can publish posts on your behalf. OAuth introduces
another component into the solution called the _Authorization Server_.

![Introducing the Authorization Server](../images/intro-oauth-5.png "Introducing the Authorization Server")

The Authorization Server establishes trust between itself and the protected
resource (your Facebook account). The green line is the goal! To establish
a connection between Strava and your Facebook account. In other words, the
goal is to establish a connection between the client and the protected
resource by delegating the user's access to the client.

For you (the OAuth user) to delegate the authorization of your Facebook
account to Strava, the following steps will occur:

1. You access Strava (the OAuth client).
2. Strava
   [redirects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Redirections)
   you to the Authorization Server.
3. You authenticate yourself to the Authorization Server.
4. You will be given a choice if you would like to delegate your
   authorization to Strava. The Authorization Server will tell you exactly
   what Strava will be able to do on your Facebook account. You consent to
   delegate authorization of your Facebook account to Strava.
5. The authorization server will send a special token to Strava called an
   _OAuth Access Token_ which will allow Strava to connect to your Facebook
   account and publish posts!
6. You have successfully delegated your authorization of your Facebook
   account. Strava is now able to make a Facebook post on your behalf.

Phew! That was a lot. The OAuth flow might be difficult to understand
by simply reading through the previous steps. To make things easier, let's
see the OAuth flow in action through an animated diagram!

## Enhancing Security

There is a potential security risk with the flow mentioned above. The
entire authorization flow is happening on the
[front channel](https://beingcraftsman.com/2023/12/02/simple-guide-to-front-channel-and-back-channel-requests/),
from the browser, which can be listened to by an attacker. In that case, an
attacker can intercept the flow and grab the OAuth Access Token for
malicious activities.

To guard the authorization flow from attackers, OAuth 2.0 has introduced
another token called the `OAuth Authorization Code`. The client receives
this code via the front channel (browser redirect) and exchanges it
securely for an access token via the back channel (direct server-to-server
request). The Access Token is communicated through the back channel. If an
attacker was intercepting the user's browser, the attacker would only be
able to access the front channel requests, not back channel, so the
attacker would not get the Access Token.

:::me
Let's recap on the difference between an **Authorization Code** and an
**Access Token**
:::
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- The **Authorization Code** is returned to the client after the user
  successfully authenticates and approves the request from the client.
- The **Access Token** is what the API will validate and use to decide
  whether to grant access to specific operations.

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::confusedDuck
So how does the Authorization Code actually get used in the flow?
:::

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The Authorization Server sends the Authorization Code to the Client after
the user grants approval. The Client then uses this Authorization Code in a
secure back-channel request to authenticate itself to the Authorization
Server and exchange the Authorization Code for an Access Token.

Once the client has the Access Token, the client can freely make Facebook
posts for the specified user.
